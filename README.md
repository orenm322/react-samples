Sample code from learning React

Code based on meeting the following requirements:

1. Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput</li>
2. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs</li>
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)</li>
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there</li>
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component</li>
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)</li>
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event</li>
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput</li>
9. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username</li>
10. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets</li>
