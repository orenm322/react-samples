Sample code from learning React
Learned from Udemy.com (https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux)

Assignment 1
/base-syntax--assignment-problem

Code based on meeting the following requirements:

1. Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
2. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
9. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
10. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets

Assignment 2
/lists-conditionals--assignment-problem

1. Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph).
2. Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop
3. Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length)
4. Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black).
5. Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.
6. When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.
